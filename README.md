# A good looking and simple md file viewer

This has a python web server(flask) that hosts a web based file picker and file viewer 

The example is from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/rowk83/digital_piracy_the_rise_of_empress_how_one_woman/) Reddit post

## Plans(for now):

- make it support mdx files properly(rn you can open them but they will act like normal md files lol)
- more user friendly process

## Usage:

- Clone it
- Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- Make a folder called "md_files"
- Put your files inside the folder
- Run the python file
- In your browser open up http://127.0.0.1:5000
